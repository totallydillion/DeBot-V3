<h1>DeBot-V3</h1>

Hi, I'm Dillion, and I have a discord bot, and I use DiscordJS, but unfortunately, because of DiscordV14, Discord changed the entire way that Discord bots are made because of *slash commands*, I originally did not like slash commands, hated them more than I hated tacos, so this respitory is for the bot that was discontinued because of slash commands becoming a thing.

<h2>Some F.A.Q</h2>
<h4>Why am I making this?</h4>
Mainly because one day I would like to reflect on the past and giggle about how bad the programming job was.

<h4>Do I plan on making a new bot? </h4>
Of course, I've already started! As much as I hate slash commands, I really love programming, and because I do not have any other ongoing projects that I am devoted to, I have came to terms with discord, and started developing a discordv14+ bot.

<h4> Will you upload the bot files for that bot </h4>
Most likely, at the moment I am just reprogramming all of the commands to get back up to speed, but because of how complex the bot is, it takes a little bit of time. My current plan is to upload all of the files from DeBotV3 (this respitory) as I am updating my discord bot to DeBotV4, so when DeBotV4 gets a command that DeBotV3 had, then the script for V3 will be posted, after all of the commands are uploaded, then I will upload all of the commands for V4, just because I don't know how Git works yet, and I'm just taking my time in learning it, even if it means being complicated in the process. It also gives me time to perfect the new bots code, instead of constantly updating in VSCode, and Git just because of a minor bug.

Essentially, Yes, I will, but not right away, because I want to perfect it before I do, DeBotV3 is kind of my last project that I am using GitHub as a "memorbilia" project,
and will start using GitHub as more of a version control type of thing, or whatever Git is used for.

<h4>What's wrong with tacos</h4>
Burritos are better, change my mind.

<h4>Invite link for the bot?</h4>
V3: V3 is discontinued now, so I would recommend getting the link for DeBotV4 when it comes out. At the moment, DeBot V4 is set to be released to the public on: TBD
